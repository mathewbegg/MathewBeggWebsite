      Hello. My name is Mathew Begg. I am in my final semester of my computer
      engineering bachelor's degree at Ryerson university. I am looking for a
      full-time software development position starting in Spring 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent 16 months working a full-time internship as a full stack developer
      at SOTI Inc. in Missisauga, Canada (6 months remotely).
    </p>
    <p>
      During my internship, I was able to collaborate effectively with all team
      members, be it QA, UX/UI, product, or other devs. My team followed
      agile/scrum principles and thus frequent communication across the team was
      vital.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to problem solve. In my free time I enjoy sports (volleyball,
      basketball, skiing), board games and video games.
